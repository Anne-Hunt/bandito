    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Bandito, the premier shopping site for all of raccoonkind.</p>
    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p><strong>What is Bandito?</strong></p>
    <p>Every raccoon finds more trash than they can consume. Bandito is a place where excess trash goes to be sold to raccoons with premium taste in goods.</p>
    <p><strong>Who runs Bandito?</strong></p>
    <p>Bandito is solely run by raccoons. We once hired an oppossum but he was too anxious to complete much of the work in such a chaotic environment.</p>
    <p><strong>Where are your goods? How do I get them?</strong></p>
    <p>We ship everything to your nearest dumpster. Shipping times vary and are at best unreliable, but we try our best to work within the system the primates have left us with.</p>
    <p><strong>Are you a joke?</strong></p>
    <p>NO! We never joke about dumpsters, raccoon rights, or the value of our wares.</p>
